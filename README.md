# JMS-Pure-Java
This is a project created to understand how JMS (Java Message Service) works using Java.

This project is created using pure Java, that means it does not use any framework support.
This project covers the following Java Messaging Servies.
* **Point-to-Point**
* **Publish-Subscriber**

Also, there is another repository for JMS-Spring. It explains how to configure and use JMSTemplate.
